i want a minimal ubuntu server fresh install to getting very minimal and dark theme globally

i want ly as my dm
i3 without the terminal, replace it with kitty

i want to make it so that it gets discord and firefox from flathub

i want to keep things looking clean and neat using the most default settings

i want my config files and folders to be really clean and short code

i want to make a really short and concise readme that will help me replicate the system again if i want to

it should go like this

get iso from here: link
once installed and rebooted run this command: single command for all the packages that will be needed like the kitty, ly, i3 without terminal, whatever else, oh yeah flathub too

it should then instruct to clone my repo for i3-setup, username is ibrahimahtsham

in the repo it should be a very simple main script that will help me apply all the configs and the symlinks

the folder structure should be like this

scripts folder with .sh files
config folder with .config files or whatever else that will be needed for i3 config, and kitty config, oh and yeah i want to have a taskbar that will show me battery, wifi connectivity, brightness, volume, time and date, cpu usage, cpu temp, gpu usage, ram usage

i will be able to scroll on volume or brightness to increase or decrease it

add a bluetooth thing too to make it so that i can launch the bluethooth manager gui or something from there

and uhhh yeah just make this read me in a way so that it keeps how to setup + what stuff i need in the bar

also save my chromebook specs as well in the readme 4gb ram, 32gb emmc storage, intel celeron N4000
